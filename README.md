Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
Heart-Disease-Prediction/
├── data_loader.py
├── machine_learning_models.py
├── deep_learning_model.py
├── evaluation.py
├── main.py
├── heart.csv

Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/hajigul/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
cd Heart-Disease-Prediction


Install Dependencies:
bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow
Running the Project
Run the Main Script:
bash
python main.py



This script will:
Load and preprocess the data. Train and evaluate machine learning models (KNeighbors Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, SVM Classifier, Logistic Regression).
Train and evaluate a deep learning model. Save the results and training plots in the D:\Preparation_for_Github\Heart Disease prediction directory.



Results
The results of the model evaluations will be saved in a text file named model_results.txt in the project directory. The training and validation accuracy and loss plots for the deep learning model will also be saved as images.
